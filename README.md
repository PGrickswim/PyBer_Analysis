# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to summarize ride-sharing by city type, highlighting the differences between urban areas, suburban areas, and rural areas. Additionally, we will view total fares for each city type during the first four months of 2019, showing how the fares compared by city type and how the average fares changed by week during this time period.

## Results

### Ride-Sharing Data by City Type

![Data Summary](https://github.com/PGrickswim/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/ridesharing_df.png)
- Summary of Ride-sharing data

As shown above, the ride-sharing data differs significantly by city type. For rural areas, there are few rides given, and a very small number (78) of drivers. While the total fares are smaller than the suburban and urban counterparts, rural rides collect a much greater average fare per driver and per ride. In suburban areas, each data point is the median of the three categories. For urban areas, there is the greatest number of rides and drivers, as well as the highest total fares; however, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are lower here than in the other two categories.

Also worth noting is that the muber of rides are greater than the number of drivers for Rural and Suburban areas, but less than the number of drivers in Urban areas. This indicates that demand for additional drivers to be on the platform is likely greater in Rural and Suburban areas than it is in Urban areas.

### Ride-Sharing Total Fares by Week

- Line Graph showing total fare by city type, over a 4-month period

Total fare by city type is shown above. Overall, despite some peaks and valleys in the weekly data, total fares are relatively consistent throughout this time period. Urban fares bring in on average just over $2,000 USD per week, Suburban fares total just over $1,000 USD per week, and Rural fares total under $500 USD per week.

## Summary

### Business Recommendations

Based on the data in this report, the following actions are recommended for maximizing revenue at PyBer

- Focus marketing in Urban areas on the rider experience. Data shows that the number of drivers is sufficient in these areas, but the number of riders may be holding the business back, by not meeding the supply of drivers.
- Focus marketing in Suburban areas on the driver experience. Data here shows that the demand of riders may be outpacing the supply of drivers. More drivers here may lead to more high-revenue rides.
- Overall, the business is strongest in Urban areas. As marketing spend and leadership focus is optimized, the Urban market should be considered as foremost in the minds of the decision-makers at PyBer. The addressible market here appears to be the largest, and while individual rides command less revenue, the aggregate of the business in the area shows the most opportunity to command a large total fare sum. 

In conclusion, it has been my pleasure to present you with this report. Please reach out with any questions or additional analysis you'd like in this area.
