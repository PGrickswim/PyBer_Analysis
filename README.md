# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to summarize ride-sharing by city type, highlighting the differences between urban areas, suburban areas, and rural areas. Additionally, we will view total fares for each city type during the first four months of 2019, showing how the fares compared by city type and how the average fares changed by week during this time period.
